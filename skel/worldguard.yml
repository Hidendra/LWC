# WorldGuard LWC module
# this module can be used to regulate where protections are placed.
# For example, you can restrict protections to specific regions
# Using '*' as one of the regions limits protections to in any region
# regionBuild limits protections to regions the player can build in
# blacklist allows you to override '*' for specific regions
