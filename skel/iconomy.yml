    # The discount will give exactly AMOUNT protections at NEWCHARGE price. If the price changes, players
    # can utilize the discount again (or if the amount is raised.)
    # E.g, if it's set to 5 (and charge = 0.00), while you have less than 5
    # protections, they are free

    # Discounts also have a 'type'. They can either be: EXACT or TOTAL
    # EXACT: The discount will give <amount> of protections at <newCharge> price: no more, no less.
    # TOTAL: The discount will charge <newCharge> price while the player has <amount> or lower total protections.
