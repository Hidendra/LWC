# Core configurable options for LWC
core:

    # The language LWC will use, specified by the shortname. For example, English = en, French = fr, German = de,
    # and so on
    locale: en

    # How often updates are batched to the database (in seconds). If set to a higher value than 10, you may have
    # some unexpected results, especially if your server is prone to crashing.
    flushInterval: 10

    # LWC regularly caches protections locally to prevent the database from being queried as often. The default is 10000
    # and for most servers is OK. LWC will also fill up to <precache> when the server is started automatically.
    cacheSize: 10000

    # How many protections are precached on startup. If set to -1, it will use the cacheSize value instead and precache
    # as much as possible
    precache: -1

    # If true, players will be sent a notice in their chat box when they open a protection they have access to, but
    # not their own unless <showMyNotices> is set to true
    showNotices: true

    # If true, players will be sent a notice in their chat box when they open a protection they own.
    showMyNotices: false

    # If true, ops will be considered LWC admins (e.g with a Permissions plugin, considered to have lwc.admin) and thus
    # will have very destructive LWC commands.
    opIsLWCAdmin: true

    # If true, LWC will not log history about protections. If you are using LWC-Economy and this is disabled, you will
    # NOT receive refunds for purchased protections
    disableHistory: false

    # if true, LWC will only allow protections to be created inside of Towns via the Towny plugin
    townyBorders: false

    # The permission node prefix that is used to match player groups when
    # no supported permission plugin is found, e.g group.vip matches the player's group as vip
    groupPrefix: 'group.'

    # If you will be notified of LWC updates
    updateNotifier: true

# "Fun" options
optional:

    # Protections are only active when a player is online.
    # So if a player is offline, anyone can access it. If the player is online, it functions normally
    onlyProtectWhenOwnerIsOnline: false

    # Protections are only active when a player is offline
    onlyProtectWhenOwnerIsOffline: false

    # Block IDs to automatically blocks from /lwc admin purge, /lwc admin expire, etc.

    # Opt out of the optional metrics tooling
    # Available online: http://metrics.griefcraft.com/plugin/LWC/
    optOut: false

    # Blocks that cannot be placed around someone else's protection. This is most useful
    blacklistedBlocks:
    - 166

    # Players that are blocked from destroying any blocks protected by LWC. Mainly useful for MCPC
    # where mods can remove blocks and try to break the block by sending an event first (e.g turtle)
    blacklistedPlayers:
    - plr

    # If protections limits will be enabled (defaults to unlimited protections)
    useProtectionLimits: true

# Database information for LWC
database:

    # The database adapter to use, for example sqlite (default) or mysql
    adapter: sqlite

    # This is strictly for SQLite only and should be left alone. When changing to MySQL and this is left intact,
    # LWC will automatically convert your protections from SQLite to MySQL
    path: 'plugins/LWC/lwc.db'

    # The MySQL host. You can specify a non-default port (3306) by adding :port, e.g host: 'localhost:3307'
    host: 'localhost'

    # The database LWC should use to store data (not necessary for SQLite)
    database: 'lwc'

    # The username LWC should use to connect to the server with (not necessary for SQLite)
    username: ''

    # The password LWC should use to connect to the server with (not necessary for SQLite)
    password: ''

    # The prefix for LWC tables. For example, a prefix of 'lwc_' will make
    # the protections table show up as lwc_protections
    prefix: 'lwc_'

    # The interval between pinging the MySQL server to keep it alive (in seconds)
    ping_interval: 300

# The protections nodes allows you to define, remove and modify which blocks LWC is allowed to protect
# This means that you could make any block you want protectable, or remove existing protectable blocks
# (e.g trap doors, etc.)
protections:
    # These values serve as default values for the protections defined under blocks

    # If true, the default behaviour will be to BLOCK redstone to protections, and /credstone on (Protection Flag)
    # will ALLOW redstone to the protection
    # If false, the default behaviour will be to ALLOW redstone to protections, and /credstone on will
    # BLOCK redstone to the protection
    denyRedstone: false

    # If true, hoppers will by blocked by DEFAULT and /chopper on will enable hopper use on them
    # If false, hoppers will be enabled by DEFAULT and /chopper on will disable hopper use on them

    # the ground

    # Used in very specific use-cases: makes LWC ignore block destruction for the given block or all blocks, allowing
    # players to remove the block and resulting protection.
    ignoreBlockDestruction: false

    # If left clicking should be ignored by LWC. An example of this would be to add ignoreLeftClick under a note block
    # protection to allow players to play the note block's note, but not change the note (which is done via right click,
    # which would be blocked by LWC.)
    ignoreLeftClick: false
